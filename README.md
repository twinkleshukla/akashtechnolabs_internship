Hi I did internship during the 14 Days internship program, conducted by <b>AKASH TECHNOLABS</b>.
The instructor during the session were Devanshi Ma'am and Akash Padhiyar Sir .I got to
learn a lot during these 14 days and it was an amazing experience learning with Akash Technolabs.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Django

<br>during these 14 days, and everything was explained from the very basics(scratch) so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 14 days.
